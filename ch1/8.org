\noindent\textbf{8.} Consider any order that turns $\mathbb{C}$ into
an ordered field.  We have that $i^2 = -1$, which according to property
1.17 (ii) of ordered fields implies $i < 0$ since $i \neq 0$.
Proposition 1.18 (a) implies that $-i > 0$.  Applying 1.17 (ii), this
time with $x = -i$ and $y = -i$, together with proposition 1.16 (d)
gives us
\begin{align*}
  (-i) \cdot (-i) = i^2 = -1 < 0.
\end{align*}
But this is a contradiciton since we assumed $\mathbb{C}$ is an
ordered field where the condition of 1.17 (ii) must be satisfied.
