\noindent\textbf{11.} If $z = 0$, then any $w \in \mathbb{C}$ such that
$|w| = 1$ together with $r=0$ satisfies $z = rw$.  For example, if $w$
equals $i$ or $1$, then $rw$ satisfy the condition.  In this case $w$
is not uniquely determined by $z$, but $r$ is.

Assume that $z \neq 0$.  Put $r = |z|$ and $w = z\cdot 1/|z|$.  Since the
real number $1/|z|$ is the multiplicative inverse of the real number
$|z|$, then clearly $|w| = 1$ by field axiom (M5) and Theorem 1.31
(b).  Now we show that $z$ can be written as $rw$,
\begin{align*}
  z = z \cdot\frac{|z|}{|z|} = |z| \Biggl( z\cdot\frac{1}{|z|} \Biggr) = rw.
\end{align*}
We may do so because multiplication is commutative and $z\neq 0 \Rightarrow |z| >
0$ by Theorem 1.31 (d).

We shall now demonstrate that whenever $z\neq 0$, then $r$ and $w$ are
uniquely determined by $z$.  Suppose not.  Then there exists $q > 0$,
$v\neq w$ such that $|v| = 1$ and $z = qv = rw$.  It follows that $|z|
= |rw| = |r||w| = r = |qv| = |q||v| = q$.  Hence $r = q$ and since $z
= rw = qv$,
\begin{align*}
  0 = rw - qu = r ( w - q ).
\end{align*}
Because $r > 0$ we have that $w = v$ and we get a contradiction since
we assumed otherwise.
