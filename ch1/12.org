\noindent\textbf{12.} We shall prove the statement using induction on
$n$.  The case $n=1$ is clearly true.  Assume the statement holds for
$n=k$.  Recall that $w = \sum_{i=1}^k z_i$ is a complex number since
$\mathbb{C}$ is closed under addition.  Then we have that
\begin{align*}
  | z_1 + z_2 + \cdots + z_{k+1} | &= \Bigg| \sum_{i=1}^k z_i + z_{k+1} \Bigg| \\
                                   &= | w + z_{k+1} | \\
                                   &\leq | w | + | z_{k+1} | \\
                                   &= | z_1 + z_2 + \cdots + z_k | + | z_{k+1} |\\
                                   &\leq | z_1 | + | z_2 | + \cdots + | z_k | + | z_{k+1} |, \\
\end{align*}
where we have used Theorem 1.33 (e) for the first inequality and the
induction hypothesis for the latter.
