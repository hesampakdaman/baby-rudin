\noindent\textbf{1} Suppose $r+x$ is rational.
Then there exists integers $m, n$ such that
\begin{displaymath}
  r + x = \frac{m}{n} \Rightarrow x = \frac{m}{n} - r.
\end{displaymath}
Since $\mathbb{Q}$ is closed under addition the RHS of the latter expression is rational.
It follows then that $x$ is rational, which is a contradiciton.
With the same line of reasoning it can be shown that $rx$ is irrational.
